"175",30001,"etherial that one must doubt whether such devices were actually realized"
"176",30001,"in practice. Thus Vitruvius writes of a wheel 4 feet in diameter and"
"177",30001,"having 400 teeth being turned by a 1-toothed pinion on a cart axle, but"
"178",30001,"it is very doubtful whether such small teeth, necessarily separated by"
"179",30001,"about 3/8 inch, would have the requisite ruggedness. Again, Hero"
"180",30001,"mentions a wheel of 30 teeth which, because of imperfections, might need"
"181",30001,"only 20 turns of a single helix worm to turn it! Such statements behove"
"182",30001,"caution and one must consider whether we have been misled by the"
"183",30001,"16th- and 17th-century editions of these authors, containing"
"184",30001,"reconstructions now often cited as authoritative but then serving as"

"358",30001,"pagoda with five tiers; on each tier was a doorway through which, at due"

"365",30001,"water wheel which seemed to set itself magically in motion at every"
