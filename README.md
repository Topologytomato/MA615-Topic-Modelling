# MA615-Topic-Modelling

# What is this?

It is a project created by MSSP 2022 fall group5. 

The topic of the project is to explore a text file by using topic modelling. The text we chose is a book : *On the Origin of Clockwork, Perpetual Motion Devices, and the Compass*. Link:https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/30001/pg30001-images.html

# Main idea
As the book contains 4 parts, we chose to use topic models with 4 topics to figure out the topics for each part.

# Package we used
### magrittr
### gutenbergr
### tidyverse
### tidytext
### dplyr
### wordcloud
### RColorBrewer
### topicmodels
### ggplot2
### dplyr
